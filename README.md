## Story and Gameplay

### Story
A player(Sedem) is on the quest to save the world from the tyrant grand trotro(GT). In order to get to GT he needs to collect as much as possible amunition for the fight. He must also die 3 times before he can get to the GT. Collecting the stars is not as easy as it sounds as there are flying birds that are constantly blocking the way and trying to eat Sedem so he can get to GT and get finish.

### Gameplay
Player uses the direction keys( up: to jump and move to upper blocks, down: to move down in a faster way, left: to move left, right: to move right).
The player can use the additional keys for extra(f: to throw fire at the enemy, d: to throw blocks at enemy )
Fire: is equivalent to 2 stars and cause more damage than a block. A player can start having a fire after he has collected 20 stars or more.
Block: is equivalent to 1 star and cause less damage.

Enemy: We have two types of enemy, the flying birds and grand trotro(GT). Flying birds are the small enemy that prevent Sedem to collect enough stars to kill GT. Flying birds can fly in any direction and kill the player on a contact. Flying birds can be kill with fire(2 stars) or 3 blocks.
